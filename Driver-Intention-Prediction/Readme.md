## ðŸ“– Abstract
This study introduces a predictive model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to anticipate driver intentions (Go Straight, Turn Right, Turn Left) in unsignalized roundabouts.  
The models integrate:
- **Kinematic data** (position, velocity, acceleration)  
- **Vehicle positioning** with fixed reference points  
- **Contextual texture features** extracted from the road environment  

The experimental results demonstrate promising predictive performance and robustness in real-world scenarios, highlighting the potential for integration into **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and autonomous driving pipelines.
