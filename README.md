As the demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies increases, accurate predictions of driver intentions in complex scenarios, such as unmarked roundabouts, become crucial. This study presents a predictive model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks that integrates kinematic motion data, vehicle positioning, and road texture analysis to anticipate whether a driver intends to turn right, turn left, or continue straight when approaching a roundabout. The model was validated using real-world data collected at unsignalized roundabouts, demonstrating effective and accurate intention prediction in practical applications. By processing data within a 20-second moving window and updating predictions every second, the approach enables continuous real-time assessment of driver intentions. These results highlight the potential of the proposed model to enhance the functionality of ADAS, particularly in environments without clear road signs. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, refining the analysis of contextual features, and adapting the model to a wider range of traffic scenarios to further improve its robustness and generalization.
